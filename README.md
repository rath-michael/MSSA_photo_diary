## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my photo diary app I completed as project 1 while attending the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy. This is a windows desktop application for uploading, storing, and displaying user images. Friendly interface gives the user the ability to categorize images by tag and location, and can be stored, edited and removed via entity framework.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* .Net Framework 4.8
* C#
* SQL
* Entity Framework w/LINQ
* XAML & SVG

## Roadmap
* As this was a classroom assignment, I have no further plans for additions or improvements
